Please refer to **tester.js** to see the Green and Yellow aspects of the backend in motion.

Simply install the required nodes, go to the backend directory and run **"node tester.js"**, and in a browser access the url "http://localhost:5000/".

From there you will be able to register to the database, login to the dashboard, manually add courses and professors, manage users (editing, adding, deleting), as well as import CSV.
