// A form that lets you search a user?
// I'm not exactly sure which format we should use
// to search. Ask Carol if we are searching by ID
// by first name, last name, etc.

// A form that reads out information about a user
// and lets you edit fields. Then a submit button to
// pursue these changes.

// Also perhaps a "Delete" button for this ^? As in
// you press the button and it deletes the user after
// asking for a warning perhaps.
// But if you don't want to put the warning you don't
// have to.

// Finally, a tab that lets you add a user with the same
// information as in register.js along with a submit
// button again.
